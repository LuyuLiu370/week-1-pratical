If you do not have any experience of using Python, you need to learn basic Python coding.\n\nYou are looking at a **Jupyter Notebook**, it is a document that mixes text, code and the output of the code. A lot of your work will be creating notebooks like this to present your analysis.  \n\n**Git** is a distributed version control system (DVCS), you will use it to keep track of your work and ensure that you have a backup copy of what you are doing. You should have checked this notebook out of **Github** using Git. Your task this week is to complete some programming work in this worksheet and commit your changes to your own Bitbucket repository.",
