# Portfolio 3
portfolio 3 is the Analysis of Mobile Price Data.

Step analysis:
These steps are used to load, clean, explore, and visualize the processing data set for further analysis or modeling. Then draw histogram graphs, box plots, heat maps and counting bar charts. 
These visualizations contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationships between the distribution, correlation, and features of the data set, providing a basis for further analysis and modeling.

Next, we use a logistic regression model for the classification task. 
By constructing a logistic regression model and using the training set for training and evaluation, the accuracy of the training set and the test set is finally output. 
These metrics can help evaluate the performance and generalization ability of the model.

Finally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used to perform classification tasks, including GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
The first part is KNN model training and evaluation using default parameters.
The second part uses GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and displays the plotted graph.
